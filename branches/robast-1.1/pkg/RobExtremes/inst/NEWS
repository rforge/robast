###############################################################################

(first two numbers of package versions do not necessarily reflect 
 package-individual development, but rather are chosen for the 
 RobAStXXX family as a whole in order to ease updating "depends" 
 information) 

#######################################
version 1.1
#######################################

user-visible CHANGES:
+ revised DESCRIPTION and staring help page	 
+ full robustness support now for ParetoFamily
+ moved "actuar" from require to imports in DESCRIPTION
+ NAMESPACE: export some formerly internal S4 classes + accessors and replacers for 
             locscaleshapename; specify from which package (actuar,evd) to take gumbel p,d,q,r
+ smaller grid of xi values as starting values for GPD and GEVD for speed reasons
+ new accessor method scale for Pareto distribution
+ new checkIC and makeIC methods for GEV[U], GPD, and Pareto
+ new script RobFitsAtRealData 
+ GEVFamily, GParetoFamily and GEVFamilyMuUnknown gain argument withMDE (by default TRUE) which controls usage of MDEs at finding startPars
+ gev/gpddiag and friends (i.e. interface to ismev methods) now apply to return values of roptest
+ new argument withMakeIC to control when to use makeIC to enhance accuracy

minor changes:
+ new Rd files for now exported (formerly internal) intermediate classes 
+ added timings for Sn 			 
+ allow for versions < 3.0 when reading grid from sysdata.rda

bug fixes:
+ fixed a sign error in FisherInfo.fct for GEV(U)
+ R CMD check did not like "usage" section in internal-methods.Rd, so we commented it out
+ in .define.tau.Dtau.withMu  (only need theta[1:2])
+ in getStartIC.R (in names risk type is without ".")
+ fixed modifyIC in "getStartIC",signature(model = "L2LocScaleShapeUnion")
+ some fixes in .checkEstClassForParamFamiliyMethods
+ class ParamWithLocAndScaleAndShapeFamParameter now contains ParamWithScaleAndShapeFamParameter

under the hood:
+ prepared everything for first release on CRAN
+ due to speed gains moved back diagnostic plot examples out of \donttest
+ added MakeIC calls in getStartIC to enhance accuracy
+ in order to avoid time-costly double calls to MakeIC, the respective modifyIC-slots gain attribute "hasMakeICin.modifyIC" once MakeIC is in the slot
+ added different route to get hand on L2Fam in gevgpddiag.R to make it applicable to return values of roptest
+ speeded up startEstGEV and startEstGPD 
+ ParetoFamily now has interpolRisks
+ ParetoFamily distribution now has speed up for Sn
+ updated/prepared plotOutlyingness.R
+ fixed unit test suite for zero length

+ in addition, now use slot locscaleshapename in generating function of GEVFamilyMuUnknown
+ new generics/methods for locationname, locscaleshapename(<-), scaleshapename, locscalename, shapename, scalename 
+ use prefix evd:: to clarify which [p,d,q,r]gumbel to take
+ L2LocScaleShapeUnion gains slot locscaleshapename = "character" / looses slot scaleshapename = "character"
+ added some more specific links to other Rd files in distrMod
+ added code for the computation of LMs for ParetoFamily

version 0.9
#######################################

Creation of this new package 

+ moved Extreme value / scale shape infrastructure from distrEx and distrMod
  (i.e. Pareto, GPareto, GEV, Weibull, Gumbel)
+ Moved script GumbelLocationModel.R from pkg ROptEst

+ created generating functions for GEV, Weibull, Pareto families  
+ PickandsEstimator (incl. as.var)

+ new L2ParamFamily GEVFamilyMuUnkown (with corresponding ES, EL, VaR)

under the hood:

+ cleaned DESCRIPTION and NAMESPACE file as to Imports/Depends
+ RobASt-Pkgs: DESCRIPTION depends become stricter (requiring distrMod, distrEx, distr >=2.4 to be on the safe side)

+ added .Rbuildignore

++ kMad:
+ kMad.c now has Unix ending (LF instead of CR, CRLF
+ removed lazyload tag in DESCRIPTION
+ deleted occurrences of ll and lr in kMad.c (as proposed by Matthias)
+ deleted dll's and .d files from distrEx src folder

+ deleted stuff from "simple" estimators (LDE, Pickands, QuantileBCC) which 
  is delegated to Estimator in distrMod() (i.e., asVar-calculations)

+ created methods for Sn and Weibull, Gammad and GEV
+ moved definition of S4 method for Sn and GPareto  from interpolSn.R to SnQn.R

+ PickandsEstimator got a corrected asVar (due to the new computation for beta, increasing the bdp;
+ mentioned the increase of BDP in the Rd file. 
+ bdpPickands committed
+ updated Metrika reference. 

+ MedkMAD now has as.var information
+ interchanged order of ParamFamily and k (medkMAD) and alpha (PickandsEstimator); 

+ implemented the Quantile estimator of Boudt Caliskan Croux for Weibull family 
  as starting estimator (together with asvarQBCC..)

+ new LDEstimate class
+ LDEstimator now uses asvar 
+ LDEstimators now may delay evaluation of variances and skip or delay
  evaluation of L2derivDistr
+ in LDEstimator.R changed ... any(is.na(es))... into
   ...any(is.na(estimate(es)))...
+ new S4-method .loc to center GParetoFamily and GEVFamily objects in LDEstimators
+ fixed an error in .LDMatch (forgot to substract loc0)

+ modularized generating functions GEVFamily, GParetoFamily, and WeibullFamily 
  [ as to defining trafo, tau, Dtau ]
+ checked and computed FI in GEV model 
+ explicit terms for the FI in the Weibull model
+ GEVFamily, ParetoFamily, WeibullFamily, GParetoFamily now have optional
  arguments
  * withCentL2 = FALSE (should L2deriv be numerically centered?
        -> formerly this was done automatically, and there was an error as
           the distribution under which centering was done was not the same
           (parameter) as the one to which L2deriv was calculated
  * withL2derivDistr: for GEVFamily, WeibullFamily, GParetoFamily this involves
       calls to imageDistr (hence random samples and calls to density()...)
       which was very costly now by default is skipped in slot call but not
       in direct calls
  * throw an error if argument startPar is no function.	   
+ GEVFamily, GParetoFamily, WeibullFamily 
   * now set new slot .withMDE to FALSE (to avoid calling CvM-MDE); 
   * .withEvalAsVar, .withEvalL2derivDistr equal to FALSE

+ getStartIC - method for interpolRisks (and hence internal-getpsi, too) moved
  from ROptEst to RobExtremes
+ getStartIC-method for interpolRisks and Sn methods now load grids from
  RobAStRDA namespace

+ added particular moveL2Fam2RefParam, moveICBackFromRefParam methods for
  scale shape models

+ considerably improved grid for Sn method for GPareto
+ finished interpolation grids (corrected a.o. Sn for GEV), 
+ produced Weibull and GEV grids (in part; RMXE still missing; MBRE-GEV gave problems)

+ non-RobExtremes-specific interpolation infrastructure gets "imported" 
  by something like .recomputeInterpolators <- ROptEst:::.recomputeInterpolators
+ minor changes in interpolation scripts
+ .mergeF and .recomputeInterpolators gain functionality to skip grids when
   merging/recomputing
+ write up to interpolation strategies
+ extract from rd file on internal interpolation infrastructure inserted 
  into interpolation/WriteUp-Interpolators.txt
+ gave more detailed comments in interpolation/interpolationscripts.R 
+ inserted scripts for generating interpol grids for GEVD Weibull Gamma
+ some diagnostic tools for interpolation grids (accessible through R-code) 
      Rdir <-  system.file("AddMaterial/interpolation", package= "RobExtremes")
      dir(Rdir)
      file.show(file.path(Rdir,"plotInterpol.R"))
+ forgot a "recursive = TRUE" in dir.create in interpolation script

+ shifted comments with auxiliary calculations to inst folder
 

+ TestInfrastructure for RobExtremes
  Tests for RobExtremes
+  to share some ideas: some test files in connection with RobExtremes
+ use of unit tests

+ wrapper functions use default rescaling controlled by S4-method rescaleFct
  dispatching on the respective model; particular methods for GEV, GPareto, 
  GEVMuUnknown

bugfixes:

+ forgot to initialize correctly slots L2derivSymm and 
  L2derivDistrSymm in GParetoFamily.R;
+ minor error in CITATION file corrected
+ removed withPos relics in GParetoFamily
+ fixed error in initialize for Pareto-distribution 
     (no lower endpoint was set)
+ some corrections in interpolation routines for GPD
+ some fixes in generating function to GParetoFamily
+ added class definition for Weibull family
+ minor correction in generating function for Weibull family
+ adapted title of the package to other RobASt-packages
+ fixed bugs in GEV-, GPareto-, and WeibullFamily
+ re-did the interpolation grids (for GPareto, so far)
+ functions where identical in grid..!
+ Corrected some errors in the scores function for the Weibull family; 
+ fixed a minor issue in GEVFamily.R and suppressed warnings in call to imageDistr
+ bug in new S4 methods for Sn / fixed
+ found reason why GEV caused problems in finding optIC s for interpoloation:
   L2Fam call called GEV instead of GEVFamily ...
+ example to medSn had to be changed / lower upper bounds to be given; otherwise there was an error.
+ argh: forgot assignment of nE in getSnGrid...
+ .LDMatch produced names like scale.scale...
