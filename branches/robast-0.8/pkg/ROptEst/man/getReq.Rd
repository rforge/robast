\title{getReq -- computation of the radius interval where IC1 is better than IC2}
\description{
 (tries to) compute a radius interval where IC1 is better than IC2
}
\usage{getReq(Risk,neighbor,IC1,IC2,n=1,upper=15)}
\arguments{
  \item{Risk}{an object of class \code{"asGRisk"} -- the risk at which IC1 is better than IC2.}
  \item{neighbor}{ object of class \code{"Neighborhood"}; the neighborhood at which to compute the bias. }
  \item{IC1}{some IC of class \code{"IC"}}
  \item{IC2}{some IC of class \code{"IC"}}
  \item{n}{the sample size; by default set to 1; then the radius interval refers to starting radii 
    in the shrinking neighborhood setting of Rieder[94]. Otherwise the radius interval is scaled
    down accordingly.}
  \item{upper}{the upper bound of the radius interval in which to search}  
}
%\details{}
\value{The radius interval (given by its endpoints) where \code{IC1} is better than \code{IC2}
according to the risk. In case \code{IC2} is better than \code{IC1} as to both variance and bias,
the return value is \code{NA}.}
