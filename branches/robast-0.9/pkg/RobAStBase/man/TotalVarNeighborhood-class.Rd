\title{Total variation neighborhood}
\description{Class of (unconditional) total variation neighborhoods.}
\section{Objects from the Class}{
  Objects can be created by calls of the form \code{new("TotalVarNeighborhood", ...)}.
  More frequently they are created via the generating function 
  \code{TotalVarNeighborhood}. 
}
\section{Slots}{
  \describe{
    \item{\code{type}}{Object of class \code{"character"}:
      \dQuote{(uncond.) total variation neighborhood}. }
    \item{\code{radius}}{Object of class \code{"numeric"}:
      neighborhood radius. }
  }
}
\section{Extends}{
Class \code{"UncondNeighborhood"}, directly.\cr
Class \code{"Neighborhood"}, by class \code{"UncondNeighborhood"}.
}
\section{Methods}{
No methods defined with class "TotalVarNeighborhood" in the signature.
