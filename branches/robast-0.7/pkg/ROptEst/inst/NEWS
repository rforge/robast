##  News: to package ROptEst
###############################################################################

(first two numbers of package versions do not necessarily reflect 
 package-individual development, but rather are chosen for the 
 RobAStXXX family as a whole in order to ease updating "depends" 
 information)

#######################################
version 0.7
#######################################

USER-VISIBLE CHANGES:


*** DUALITY BASED optIC-ALGORITHM

-> optional use of alternative algorithm to obtain Lagrange multipliers
   using duality based optimization 
-> rewritten algorithm:
+  getInfRob_asGRisk.R     now have both an iterative and an optimization
+  getInfRob_asHampel.R    algorithm to obtain Lagrange Multipliers;
       --- i.e. depending on argument OptOrIter (default: iteration as before...)
       they call  getLagrangeMultByOptim resp. getLagrangeMultByIter
       (unfortunately: optimization is slow; only L-BFGS-B works satisfactory)
+ getInfLM now gains (unfortunately not a good idea as to speed!) the new 
  MSE - optimization routines for obtaining LagrangeMultipliers

*** optIC Solution for general trafo / with nuisance

+ we now can digest case p=1, k>1 for asymmetric biastypes as well as for total variation
+ implemented lower Case solution for *=v p=1 k>1
+ roptest gains arguments withUpdateInKer, IC.UpdateInKer, na.rm

*** others

+ added argument fsCor to function roptest enabling a finite-sample correction of the radius ...


SCRIPTS

+ all scripts do run now without (obvious) error ---
    at the exception of NormalLocationScaleModel.R --- 
    and there the radiusminimax solution for self-standardization ...
+ in script GammaModel.R,  added comment due to new E method in distrEx 
  which increases precision of certain computations.
+ scripts in part now with R output in comment
+ new example with k=15 steps in script PoissonModel.R
+ example for lower Case solution for *=v p=1 k>1 added in script NormalLocationScaleModel.R
+ new example for trafo-based model in script NormalLocationScaleModel.R
+ inserted some new lines in script NormalLocationScaleModel.R
  --- now has an example with nuisance parameters

GENERAL ENHANCEMENTS:

+ added TOBEDONE (sic!) files; in English (for possible collaborators) 
+ added keyword robust and made some minor corrections ...
+ added/updated NEWS files, updated CITATION files using code by A. Zeileis

+ Rd-parsing:
  * patch for Brian Ripley's
    Re: [Rd] Warning: missing text for item ... in \describe?
  * fixed errors / warnings in .Rd files detected by parser 2 
    (c.f. [Rd] More intensive checking of R help files, Prof Brian Ripley, 09.01.2009 10:25)

+ svn-revision-tags 
  * added in all DESCRIPTION files
  * added field "Encoding: latin1" to all DESCRIPTION files because
    substituting $LastChangedDate by svn would cause problems for
    packages built under Windows (German) local when checking under Linux.

+ removed pdf-file from version control - Rnw-file is sufficient


INTERNALLY:

+ k dimension / p dimension  -- trafo & nuisance
  * lower case and Hampel now seem to work with trafo
  * in getInfRob_asHampel: added argument checkBounds, setting this to FALSE 
    clearly speeds up computations for asHampel Risk
  * cniper contamination now also available for partial ICs
  * slightly modified b search range in MSE problem -- in the hope it will do 
    for Totalvariation neighborhood, p=1, k>1 
  * new: getAsRisk for "asBias", "RealRandVariable", "TotalVarNeighborhood" and "ANY"
  * getModifyIC has been changed so that also nuisance parameter models
    can be covered.

+ new IC algorithm 
  * upper by default is now set to NULL in getInfRobIC_asGRisk, getInfRobIC_asHampel, getIneffDiff
  * slightly modified b search range in MSE problem -- in the hope it will do 
    for Totalvariation neighborhood, p=1, k>1 
  * outsourced several steps in getInfRob_asGRisk.R and getInfRob_asHampel.R  
    into internal, non-exported functions
    .getLowUpB() .getLowerSol() .getUpperSol() .checkUpLow()
  * radiusMinimaxIC gains argument loRad0 to be able to adjust 
    the lower search bound (for getIneffDiff) case by case.
  * getInfCent, getInfGamma 
    - uses getLow/getUp now
    - changed search interval for getInfCent Totalvariation one-dim
    - use of lower.tail = FALSE instead of 1-p in 
  * verbosity:
    - for rob.-opt. ICs: in verbose mode now an automatic check for [p]IC is done
    - optIC, getIneffDiff, getInfLM, getInfRob, 
      leastFavorableRadius, .LowerCaseMultivariate.R[TV],
      radiusMinimaxIC gain default NULL for argument verbose
      in these function we check for is.null and if so set it
      to getRobAStBaseOption("all.verbose")
    - new helper function .checkPIC for checking within getInfRobIC
    - work on pretty printing if verbose == TRUE, ...
    - getIneffDiff now inhibits permanent checks for IC even if verbose==TRUE
    - in addition to precision information, current Lagrange multipliers are issued if verbose==TRUE
      (but only every 5 iterations in asGRisk- and every 15 in asBias-method for getInfRobIC)
  * lowerCase solutions now count the number of iterations
  * changed detault search interval for r in radiusMinimaxIC.R
  * changed default search interval for b in getInfRobIC_asGRisk (one-dim)
  * getLagrangeMultBy[...]() gain arg a.start to transmit the actual 
    centering / clipping modification in transformed models

+ Risk slot
  * made Risk slot slightly more consistent (no longer double asMSE),
    in particular in case there is no convergence.

+ roptest 
  * now has an argument initial.est.ArgList to transmit arguments
     for a call to initial.est (for those familiar with it: 
     similarly to startEstArgList in roptest.gpareto...)
  * roptest gains arguments withUpdateInKer, IC.UpdateInKer, na.rm

+ getmodifyIC
  * new generic scaleUpdateIC  for scale-Update in 
    location/scale/locscale models
    -> to avoid similar code for the many variants
    ScaleModel, LocationScaleModel, LocationUnknownScaleModel,
    ScaleUnknownLocationModel; in the latter two also
    totalvariation nbds are allowed
  * getModifyIC gains ... argument
    and for signature((L2FamIC = "L2ParamFamily", 
                       neighbor = "Neighborhood", risk ="asRisk")
    inserts a verbose= getRobAStBaseOption("all.verbose")
    into modifyIC-slot


BUGFIXES:


+ scripts
  * two minor buglets in scripts NormalLocationScaleModel.R & UnderOverShootRisk.R
  * small shape parameters in GammaModel.R 
    lead to functions which are hard to integrate numerically; 
    added some code to demonstrate this ...
 
+ k dimension / p dimension issues
  * fixed issues with polymorph nature of slot param of ParamFamParameter:
    now we can determine opt-rob ICs for trafos; annotation gets right;
    see example(comparePlot)
  * Symmetry slots did not work correctly for non-trivial trafos 
    (at least would have to be reworked); now: all entries are computed
  * in ..asHampel: bmax had to be converted to matrix in case p=1, k>1

+ new IC algorithm issues
  * in MSE-method (as iter <= 1 always), clipping bounds in weights 
    in Total Variation case (p=1, k>1) were never updated 
    -> new helper functino .isVirginW
  * small bugs removed in getInfRobIC_asGRisk, getInfRobIC_asHampel, getInfClip
  * std (standardization in non-standard norms) was not updated correctly in getLagrangeMultBy[...]

+ roptest
  * modifies slot start of return value to become initial.est argument

+ others:
  * definition of weight was missing in getInfRobIC_asCov.R
  * small bug in getAsRisk. Now radiusMinimaxIC works for models with trafo.
  * corrected a simple bug in scaleUpdateIC for UncondNeighborhoods 
  * fixed an error in getModifyIC in the computation of the transferred risks
  * fixed a buglet in getModifyIC.R:
    had to cast out a second appearance of argument verbose (within ...) ...
  * getAsRisk for "asBias", "RealRandVariable", "ContNeighborhood" and "ANY" 
    was lacking argument Finfo and did not check for verbose
  * minor documentation bug in radiusMinimaxIC.Rd


TO BE CHECKED 

+ remains to be done: self standardization does not yet work...
+ total variation nbd: case 1=p<k works but still some checking needed.
+ to be checked: symm for total variation
