                RobAStRDA once again ... 

sorry to bother you with this again, we have been here before,
and there is an extensive mail exchange on this on CRAN archives
(last time 19.09.2013 13:43 "Re: CRAN submission RobAStRDA 0.9")
and some offline exchange with Uwe on this afterwards.

To cut it short: Our package fails by size. We do not see how
to fix this; it is a database with interpolators; i.e., grids
for speed up of computations, but in addition also many interpolating
R-functions (with their environment) -- the results of approxfun (to 
produce the interpolating function only once and not each time on the 
fly on call). One clue might be that we simultaneously store pre R-3.0
and post R-3.0 environments (and at run-time decide which branch to
take according to version information), and that the compression does
not work well in post R-3.0 for pre R-3.0-environments ...

Anyway: Our sysdata.rda data set is xz compressed already but during 
check gets extracted, throwing the note that our package is too large; 
lazyload and putting the data somewhere else does not help either (and 
even gets worse as to size).

Uwe was so nice to offer some of his time to look at it, so maybe you
find some trick? 

Another way out would be to host the package somewhere else (in some
drat type repo with infrastructure of Dirk Eddelbuettel's) if we may
link to non CRAN-repos in a suggests/depends field of another package.

Any help appreciated, best, Peter

argh: sorry been a long day...

The package version 
  just sent was using the wrong data base; I have fixed 
  this; the effect though is still the same as in the 
  previous submission, but now, due to some more grids 
  my colleagues have produced by now, the package has 
  even grown a bit larger = 4.5 MB xz compressed, 10 MB 
  during R CMD check...
